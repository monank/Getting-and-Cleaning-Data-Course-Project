## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Information about the experiment and data can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This course project is to gather data from the dataset, merge them, and clean it for analysis. The experiment had 30 volunteers between the ages of 19 and 48 years old perform six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying) while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist.
